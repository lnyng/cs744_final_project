CS 744 Big Data Systems Group 26 Final Project

This repo contains all code we used for our final project, which
benchmarks Kafka on different configurations. The experiments are ran on
a cloudlab cluster with 3 brokers and 3 producers.

The ProducerPerformance.java is adapted from the built-in class with the
same name, so that it runs multiple producer threads. The built-in
consumer ConsumerPerformance is used without modification.

run.sh is used to run all experiments, and the gather.sh in data
directory is used to gather data from three producer nodes and parse.py
processes the gathered data for plotting with plot.py.

end-to-end directory contains adapted classes for measuring end-to-end
latency, which is achieved by sending a timestamp in the record and the
consumer calculates the time difference when a record is received.
